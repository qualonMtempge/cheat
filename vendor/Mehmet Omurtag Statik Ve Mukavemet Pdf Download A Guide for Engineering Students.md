The book is divided into two parts: Statik (Statics) and Mukavemet (Strength of Materials). The first part covers the basic principles of statics, such as equilibrium of forces, moments, couples, free-body diagrams, trusses, frames, friction, centroids, and moments of inertia. The second part covers the basic concepts of strength of materials, such as stress and strain, Hooke's law, axial loading, shear stress and strain, thermal stress and strain, torsion of circular shafts, bending of beams, shear force and bending moment diagrams, deflection of beams, combined loading, stress transformation, Mohr's circle, failure criteria, columns, and energy methods.
  
The book is written in Turkish and uses the SI system of units. It contains many examples and problems that illustrate the application of the theory to practical situations. The book also provides solutions to some of the problems at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable for undergraduate students who are taking courses in statics and strength of materials or for anyone who wants to refresh their knowledge on these subjects.
